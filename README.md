# USEPA/EPA_HD_CTI_BCA

The CTI BCA tool was developed by EPA to estimate costs and benefits (only those based on a dollar-per-ton accounting) of the proposed CTI rulemaking options.
The tool is written in Python (version 3.8) and makes use of several input files that specify, for example, costs for technology expected to be added to vehicles to facilitate compliance,
vehicle populations and sales, fuel consumption, vehicle miles traveled, etc.
